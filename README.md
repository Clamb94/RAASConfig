## vRAAS for MSFS

Our vRAAS system provides runway awareness and advisory features similar to real-world systems.  
All functions behave **exactly** like the real ones and can be disabled if desired.

- vRAAS works on all airports (including 3rd party add-ons)
- vRAAS works with all aircraft
- Text Display on PFD/ND (see notes below)
- No setup required
- Auto-Updating
- Female/Male voices
- Fully customizeable
- Auto-start and auto-close option
- Minimize-to-tray and minimized-on-startup available

Limitations:
- Text Display on PFD/ND is experimental and may get disabled/broken by future MSFS updates
- Due to MSFS limitations, the **_TOO FAST_** callout is not available on all aircraft
